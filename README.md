# notes-on-crypto-stuff

This is be where i will take down notes of everything i learn so far

# Bitcoin Transaction
Guy creates a dropbox thing also known as an address. It is disposable and he has the key, he sends the address to the guy that's gonna send him the btc and that's how a transaction works. This is my first note, if it's somehow false, I'll update it.. Or not

# Money
Commodity: items have value. examples: bear pelt, beaver pelt, wool, rawr materials, etc.
Representative: stuff like gold certificates, paper, etc are considered valueable.
Fiat: the government declares what has value, i.e, money - euro, yen, rupee, etc.
